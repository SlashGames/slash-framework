## Step 1: Choose what to do

If you've got no idea how to help, head over to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/npruehs/slash-framework/issues) and see what you'd like to do most. You can basically pick anything you want to, as long as it's not already assigned to anyone.

Slash Framework is developed using the [GitFlow branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). In order to contribute, you should check out the latest develop branch, and create a new feature or hotfix branch to be merged back.

## Step 3: Implement your feature or bugfix

We recommend using [StyleCop](http://stylecop.codeplex.com/) for verifying your code against our [coding guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff926074.aspx).

## Step 4: Open a pull request
